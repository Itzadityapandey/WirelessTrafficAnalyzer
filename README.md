# Wireless Traffic Analyzer

Wireless Traffic Analyzer is a Python-based GUI application for analyzing and capturing network traffic. The project leverages `Scapy` for packet sniffing and `PyQt6` for an interactive user interface. It provides detailed insights into TCP packets traveling through a selected network interface.

## üìÇ Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

1. **`main.py`**  
   - This is the primary entry point for the application.  
   - It provides the graphical user interface (GUI) using `PyQt6`, allowing users to select a network interface, start/stop packet sniffing, and view live packet logs.

2. **`sniffer.py`**  
   - Contains the core logic for packet capturing using `Scapy`.  
   - Handles TCP/IP packet parsing and formats the output for the GUI.

3. **`requirements.txt`**  
   - Lists all the Python dependencies required for the project to run.  
   - Includes libraries like `PyQt6` and `Scapy`.

## ‚ú® Features

- **GUI-Based Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for selecting network interfaces and starting/stopping sniffing.  
- **Live Packet Capture**: Captures and logs live TCP/IP packets in real-time.  
- **Verbose Mode**: Optional verbose mode for capturing non-TCP/IPv4 packets with additional details.  
- **Error Handling**: Provides clear error messages for invalid configurations or permission issues.

## üîß Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/wireless-traffic-analyzer.git
   cd wireless-traffic-analyzer
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed. Then, install the required libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application**  
   Execute the `main.py` file to launch the application:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Permissions**  
   - **Linux/macOS**: Run with root/admin privileges:
     ```bash
     sudo python main.py
     ```
   - **Windows**: Open the terminal as an administrator and then run the script.

## üìñ Usage

1. Launch the application using `python main.py`.
2. Select a network interface from the dropdown menu.
3. (Optional) Enable Verbose Mode to capture additional packet details.
4. Click **Start Sniffing** to begin capturing packets.
5. View live logs of captured packets in the text area.
6. Click **Stop Sniffing** to end the session.

## üßæ Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- PyQt6
- Scapy
- datetime

Install all dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## üö® Troubleshooting

- **Permission Denied**:  
  Run the application as administrator (Windows) or with `sudo` (Linux/macOS).

- **No Interfaces Found**:  
  Ensure your network interfaces are properly configured and accessible. Use the `get_if_list()` function from Scapy to debug interface availability.

- **Invalid Interface Selected**:  
  Verify that the selected interface is valid and actively connected to a network.
